## Welcome to pathFinding in Java

This is the implementation of major pathfinding algorithms A* and Dijkstra in Java. This was a project in the Object Oriented Programming Course at Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani. We have used Swing for simple GUI implementation, which is completely optional.
Suggestions are welcome, thanks!

## Folder Structure

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
