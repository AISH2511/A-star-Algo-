## Welcome to pathFinding in Java

This is the implementation of major pathfinding algorithms A* and Dijkstra in Java. This was a project in the Object Oriented Programming Course at Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani. We have used Swing for simple GUI implementation, which is completely optional.

Input and Output structure:

The input consists of several steps.
The first input specifies the number of cities. It is important to note that if we have N cities, then the city names go from 0 to N-1.
The second input will be the total number of connections between the cities.
The third input consists of multiple lines, where each line consists of two city names and the distance between them.
For example, if the distance between cities 0 and 1 is 4, then the input should be 0 1 4
The fourth input will be the city along with its coordinates.
For example, if the city 5 is located at (2,3) then the input will be as follows: 5 2 3
The fifth and final input will be the cities between which we need to find the shortest distance.
For example, if we want to find the shortest distance between Cities 0 and 6,
Then the input should be 0 6.
The output will be the shortest distance between the required cities using A star Algorithm followed by the shortest distance between the required cities using Dijkstra Algorithm.

Suggestions are welcome, thanks!

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
